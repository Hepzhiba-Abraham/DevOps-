# Task: Temporary User Setup with Expiry

## Objective
Create a temporary user account named `yousuf` on App Server 1 (stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com) in the Stratos Datacenter. The account should automatically expire on 2024-01-28, ensuring limited access for a developer working on the Nautilus project.

## Infrastructure Details

Server Name: stapp01  
IP Address: 172.16.238.10  
Hostname: stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com  
User: tony  
Password: Ir0nM@n  
Purpose: Nautilus App 1

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin:
- You must have access to the jump host or terminal to SSH into stapp01.
- You need the login credentials for the server (tony / Ir0nM@n).
- Basic familiarity with Linux commands is helpful.

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Connect to App Server 1 via SSH

Open your terminal and run:
```
ssh tony@stapp01
```

If prompted:
```
The authenticity of host 'stapp01 (172.16.238.10)' can't be established...
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
```

Type `yes` and press Enter. Then enter the password:
```
Ir0nM@n
```

---

### 2. Switch to the Root User

Once logged in, elevate your privileges:
```
sudo su -
```

Enter tony's password again when prompted.

---

### 3. Check if the User Already Exists

Run:
```
cat /etc/passwd | grep yousuf
```

If there's no output, the user doesn't exist yet.

---

### 4. Create the Temporary User

Run:
```
sudo useradd -e 2024-01-28 yousuf
```

This creates the user `yousuf` and sets the account to expire on January 28, 2024.

---

### 5. Confirm the Expiry Date

Run:
```
sudo chage -l yousuf
```

Expected output:
```
Account expires : Jan 28, 2024
```

---

## Outcome

The user `yousuf` has been successfully created on stapp01 with an expiry date of 2024-01-28. This ensures temporary access for the duration of the assignment.

---

## Security Tips

- Use lowercase usernames for consistency.
- Always set expiry dates for temporary users.
- Use `sudo` carefullyâ€”root access gives full control.
- Monitor and remove accounts when no longer needed.

---

## Notes

- No password was set for `yousuf`; configure access method separately (e.g., SSH key).
- Consider automating cleanup of expired accounts if needed.
