# 🛡️ Creating User `mariyam` with Non-Interactive Shell on App Server 2

This guide outlines the steps to create a user named `mariyam` with a non-interactive shell on **App Server 2 (`stapp02`)**. This configuration is typically used for service accounts or automation users that should not have login access.

## 🔐 Server Access Details

| Server Name | IP Address     | Hostname                        | Username | Password |
|-------------|----------------|----------------------------------|----------|----------|
| stapp02     | 172.16.238.11  | stapp02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com | steve    | Am3ric@  |

---

## 🛠️ Steps to Create the User

1. **SSH into App Server 2**
   ```bash
   ssh steve@stapp02
   ```
   > Enter password: `Am3ric@`

2. **Switch to Root User**
   ```bash
   sudo su -
   ```
   > Enter password again if prompted.

3. **Check if User Already Exists**
   ```bash
   cat /etc/passwd | grep mariyam
   ```

4. **Create the User with Non-Interactive Shell**
   ```bash
   useradd mariyam --shell /sbin/nologin
   ```

5. **Verify User Creation**
   ```bash
   cat /etc/passwd | grep mariyam
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   mariyam:x:1002:1002::/home/mariyam:/sbin/nologin
   ```

## ✅ Verification Summary

- The user `mariyam` should now exist.
- The shell `/sbin/nologin` ensures the user cannot log in interactively.
- This setup is ideal for background processes or restricted service accounts.

## 📌 Notes

- You can also use `/bin/false` as a non-interactive shell.
- Always confirm user permissions and group memberships if the account is tied to a service.
- For audit purposes, document this change in your infrastructure logs or version control.
