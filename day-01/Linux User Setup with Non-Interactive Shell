Task: Create a user named 'mariyam' with a non-interactive shell on App Server 2

Server Details:
---------------
Server Name: stapp02
IP Address: 172.16.238.11
Hostname: stapp02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
Username: steve
Password: Am3ric@

Steps:
------

1. Open your terminal.

2. Connect to App Server 2 using SSH:
   Command:
   ssh steve@stapp02
   When prompted, enter the password: Am3ric@

3. Switch to the root user to perform administrative tasks:
   Command:
   sudo su -
   Enter the password again if prompted.

4. Check if the user 'mariyam' already exists:
   Command:
   cat /etc/passwd | grep mariyam
   If no output appears, the user does not exist.

5. Create the user 'mariyam' with a non-interactive shell:
   Command:
   useradd mariyam --shell /sbin/nologin

6. Confirm the user was created successfully:
   Command:
   cat /etc/passwd | grep mariyam
   Expected output:
   mariyam:x:1002:1002::/home/mariyam:/sbin/nologin

Explanation:
------------
- The 'useradd' command creates a new user.
- The '--shell /sbin/nologin' option sets the shell to a non-interactive one, preventing login access.
- This setup is useful for service accounts or users that should not have terminal access.

Notes:
------
- You can also use '/bin/false' instead of '/sbin/nologin' for similar behavior.
- Always verify user creation using the /etc/passwd file.
- Make sure you have root privileges to create users.
